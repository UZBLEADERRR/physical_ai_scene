# S1 — Sensors & calibration tools (reference implementation, to be reviewed by S1)

> **Authorship.** The S1 bags were recorded by S1 (Ulmasov Muzaffar). The code in `src/sensors/`
> was written with Claude Code (AI): `bag_replay.py` for the demo platform, and the three tools
> below as a reference implementation of roadmap §11.1. S1 reviews them, runs them on the real
> bags and reports the numbers as their own measurements.

| Roadmap item (§11.1) | Tool | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Save intrinsics (the skipped S0 bag) | `python -m src.sensors.calibration --images <dir> \| --bag <S0 bag> --pattern 9x6 --square 0.025 --out <dir>` | `camera_intrinsics.yaml` (same keys as `configs/sensors/`), `calibration_report.csv` (RMS per view, outliers) |
| Documented TF; measured camera height and pitch | `python -m src.sensors.static_tf --frames <exported frames> --out <dir>` | `static_tf.yaml` (map → camera_link xyz / rpy, height, pitch, spread over frames, vs the configured placeholder), `static_tf.json` |
| Use the measured TF in the pipeline | `python main_pipeline.py --bag <bag> --camera-tf auto` (or `--camera-tf static_tf.json`) | every frame uses the desk-plane TF |
| 30 FPS stability; timestamp sync error | `python -m src.sensors.session_report --bag <bag> --out <dir>` | `session_meta.json`: measured FPS, frame gaps, RGB↔depth offset mean / p95 / max |
| Invalid-depth % on glass / shiny / dark | same, with `--frames <exported frames with S3 output>` | `depth_quality.csv`: valid-depth %, median distance, depth noise per object |
| Reprojection / deprojection consistency | `calibration.deprojection_consistency(depth, K)` | round-trip error in pixels |

Export frames from a bag first: `python -m src.sensors.bag_replay --bag <bag> --out <dir>`.

Checked on synthetic data only (`tests/test_s1_sensors.py`): calibration recovers fx to 1 % from
12 simulated views; the desk-plane TF recovers the mock camera (0.60 m, 45°) to 1 cm / 1°. The real
bags are not in the repository, so the real numbers (e.g. the ≈ 0.32 m / ≈ 52° seen by S2 against the
0.80 m placeholder) have to be produced by S1 with these commands.
